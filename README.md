# Big-Data_Machine_learning_with_SparkML

' **CardioViscularStudy Project**

' This repository contains a project for analyzing and predicting cardiovascular disease using data analysis and visualization in Python, as well as machine learning with Apache Spark in Java.

### Data Analysis and Visualization (Python)
#### Libraries Used
- **Pandas (pd)**: Pandas is used for data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy (np)**: NumPy is used for numerical computing and array operations.
- **Matplotlib.pyplot (plt)**: Matplotlib is used for creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations in Python.
- **Seaborn (sns)**: Seaborn is used for statistical data visualization.

#### Steps
1. Load the dataset using Pandas from "bank.csv".
2. Perform data analysis and visualization.

### Machine Learning with Apache Spark (Java)
#### Steps
1. Define the Spark session and schema for the data.
2. Load the training data and perform preprocessing.
3. Train various classifiers including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Decision Tree.
4. Evaluate the models and save the predictions.

#### Note
Before running, ensure that the IDE configuration is set to application settings with "src/main/resources/input src/main/resources/output" as arguments.
The project is currently configured to run locally but can be modified to run on a cluster.
